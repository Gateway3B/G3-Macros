# G3 AHK Macros
These are the AHK macros I use. Run `Macros.ahk` to run them all together.

## Virtual Desktop Enhancer
This uses the `VirtualDesktopAccessor.dll` by [Ciantic](https://github.com/Ciantic/VirtualDesktopAccessor). It moves `Spotify` and `Discord` with you as you change virtual desktops. You can use the `Right Windows Key` to toggle your currently selected application to also follow. (`Left Ctrl Key` + `Left Windows Key` + `Side Arrow Keys` to change current desktop)(`Left Ctrl Key` + `Left Windows Key` + `D Key` to create new desktop)

## Google Bang
If you are in a DuckDuckGo search window, and you can't find what you want, this macro will copy your current search string and use a google bang `!g` to search for the same thing in google. The activator is `Right Alt Key`.

## Quick One Note
`Right Ctrl Key` will open a quick One Note page if One Note process is running.
